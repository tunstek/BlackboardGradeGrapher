# BlackboardGradeGrapher

ONLY WORKING FOR TCD BLACKBOARD

An extension for Google Chrome to display a graph of your results in the "My Grades" section.

Known Issues:
Default graph selection is not disabled at first.
If the label is toggled and the graph is then changed, the label is toggled back to date.
Large labels are making the graph much smaller (Need to truncate labels)
Need to limit overall percentage to 2 decimal places
