# BlackboardGradeGrapher

CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS FOR TCD BLACKBOARD

An extension for Google Chrome to display a graph of your results in the "My Grades" section. This extension gives a graphical representation of your results throughout a module in the form of either a line graph or a bar chart. 






Known Issues:
Toggled labels is not persistent across graph changes

Future updates:
Dynamic scaling of the graph based on the number of results.
We would like to expand this feature to other blackboards in the future
